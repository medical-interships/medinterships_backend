for now doctor and dean work the rest are still in the testing and fixing stage


check list:
-----------


1.make the documents downlaoder and make it compatible with pdfs and store it in a separate folder or what ever you know that is effective and works. 

2.make notification socket (notifications are affected by the admin and chief of service).

3.fix the render issue in the backend (Elhadi is doing that dont touch those).

4.check for compatability issues with frontend and integrate the backend with the frontend (after Elhadi finishes the render issue).
