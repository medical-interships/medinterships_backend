the site backend
the admin (dean) apis are working i still didn't test the others and i know that woill take some time but for now the admin is working if y'all want to run it in your local the compatibility issue with the front end will be addressed soon so stay tuned and thanks for your coaporation.



for now doctor and dean work the rest are still in the testing and fixing stage


check list:
-----------


1.make the documents downlaoder and make it compatible with pdfs and store it in a separate folder or what ever you know that is effective and works(only needs to retrieve the right data for the right place the downloading part works ) so just retrieve with the student id in it and for what goes where just take the last bit of the url and make it go by that logic (.ong is profile photo and pdf is for cv). 

2.make notification socket (notifications are affected by the admin and chief of service).

3.check for compatability issues with frontend and integrate the backend with the frontend (after Elhadi finishes the render issue).
